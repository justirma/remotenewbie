A letter to founders and managers,

If you’re a startup founder or you’re a hiring manager whose company has held a physical office with no remote employees, it’s sorta time for you to think about why this is. As the wave of millennials starts breaking and changing the workforce (for the better) there are going to major changes in the way on-boarding, job descriptions, inclusion, communications and more start to evolve.

I mean, we’re seeing it right now

> Gallup’s [State of the American Workplace Report](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx) concluded that 43% of employees work remotely at least some of the time. And among those who work remotely at least part of the time, the percent of employees who work remotely 100% of the time is now 20%, up from 15% four years prior.

This is HUGE. The more access technology brings the faster we’re going to see emerging and rising demand for opportunities that allow folks to have:

1. flexible scheduling
2. autonomy
3. PTO
4. no commute
5. freedom
6. settings that allow for optimal productivity

So, if you know of a company that is not keeping up with the trend of remote work or maybe you are someone who’s trying to figure out the space of remote work so that you can start exposing your teams to it.

## Here are my actionable suggestions

### Take a step back

- Pull up your employees, document their responsibilities, interactions with co-workers, and communications with customers - can any of these roles be done from home? That’s it. 1 simple question to ask yourself. Can all of the roles at my company be done from anywhere where this is solid internet connection? If you have a digital product, the answer is most likely, yes.

### Educate

- No team can be built without ground-work and attention. Remote work has been around for a bit and some companies have somewhat perfected what it looks like to manage and structure a fully functioning remote team. Some of my favorites are, [Buffer](https://remote.co/company/buffer/) and [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/). Read through the docs and share your findings with your team. Find what progress and successes did these companies make by having a fully remote team? Let me tell you, a ton. Why? Because the setting where you work doesn’t take away the effort, intelligence and thought behind executing work.

### Start with 1 employee or 1 team

- When I first started working remotely I was the first in-office employee to go off and start working remote from another location 1,000 miles away from HQ. Starting with 1 allows companies to experiment, document and course-correct as they work to define expectations of having remote employees.

These 3 suggestions are suggestions. But those that commit to doing all three, starting right now are way ahead of the game.
