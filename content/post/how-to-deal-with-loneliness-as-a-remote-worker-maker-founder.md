Ever since I've started to work remote I've felt loneliness almost consistently.

It's normal to feel this way and if you're feeling this way right now, please know that you're not alone.

Remote work can be isolating. It's true. Everyone knows it but we find creative ways to overcome it. It does require a bit of extra effort so be prepared! Unfortunately, we aren't in an office environment where being around other humans for 8 hours a day is a given.

Let's dive into a few ways you can sorta defeat the lonely while working from home or at least how to get comfortable with it.

### Online communities

This is probably the most accessible for many remote workers. Finding online communities that are dedicated spaces for remote folks, digital nomads or location independent individuals has the lowest barrier to entry. These spaces are usually free and they're made up the most genuine and easy-going people who are feeling the lonely as well.

Join a space, you can probably do a quick Google search. Try staying active in the community and maybe you'll even end up with a few internet friends you can chat with daily.

### Co-working spaces (virtual or physical)

Co-working spaces are fantastic as they provide that in-office feeling without actually being at your work office. These spaces are usually spacious, clean, homey, and provide you with free coffee, snacks, and wifi. The biggest plus is that other people are working on their projects as well! So you can swoop into a desk with another co-worker and work near them making it feel as if you're not working alone.

Some co-working spaces require memberships but some allow day passes to be purchased for a relatively affordable price. It's an easy way to get out of the house and into a super quiet space.

Small plug. I run a virtual co-working meetup for minorities. You can find it by going to this link. It's free and a space where you can feel safe and accountable in getting your work done. We meet weekly for 1 hour and try to hit 1 or 2 goals per meetup.

### Coffee shops

Okay, so I may have some disagreements here because it's too loud and you leave smelling like delicious Central American coffee beans (who doesn't love this?!?) but I still believe that coffee shops are my sweet place. It's not too expensive like frequenting a co-working space but it's low cost to be able to be near other people.

It's also super simple to strike up a random conversation in line or with the barista. There you go! Your human interaction for the day, complete! But seriously, coffee shops are a great choice to keep in mind. If you're not a coffee drinker there's usually tea, sparkling water, etc. there for you and + free wifi and stuff for snacking.

### Meetups

For us introverted remote workers this may be the last thing we want to do BUT hear me out you'll find lots of opportunities at meetups to network and find others who are int he same boat as you.
